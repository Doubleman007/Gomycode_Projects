# This repository contain projects for Gomycode Data Science Program
In the first project housing price prediction I demonstrate a strong data scientist skill by predicting housing prices using machine learning. This project leverages regression models to estimate property values based on various features.

For the second project I showed strong data scientist skill by building personalized movie recommendations using machine learning. This project utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based methods to suggest movies based on user preferences.

For the last project Citrone performance I trained a machine learning model to predict whether a student qualifies from the beginner class to the intermediate class or not from the Stutern learning management platform (Citrone).
